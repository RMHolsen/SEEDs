# SEEDs

Yes that is a Trigun reference, in case you were wondering. 

Project SEEDs is, in this case, a web application to keep track of plants grown from seed and determine the best course of action, from planting environment to packaging time, for raising healthy and fertile plants. A group of seeds planted in a quad or six-pack plant pot (or in some cases in individual peat cups) is called a 'pod', and each pod may be subject to different conditions or hold different seeds. For example, a user might record a mullein pod of six in a seedling rack under grow lights, and a separate mullein pod of six on a tray outdoors in full sun, to compare and determine which conditions are best for growth.

A pod must be entered without a germination count. Once the pod has had some time to grow the pod can be edited and germination rates can be recorded. It is recommended to start a separate pod each time you plant, rather than aggregate everything into the germination rate of one plant over several years worth of conditions as conditions are never entirely replicable except in lab conditions, which most people won't have access to.
